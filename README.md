# Export Stems

Export Stems is an extension for Adobe Premiere Pro that automatically exports each audio track of the active sequence as a WAV file. 

This extension is tested and optimized for macOS and Adobe Premiere Pro version 2023 or later. Functionality on other operating systems or older versions of Premiere is not guaranteed.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

First, [download the zip folder from this link](https://github.com/JSP-Premiere-Pro-Panel-Extensions/jsp.exportStems/files/13877586/jsp.exportStems.zip). Then, unzip the file on your computer. 

You should now have a folder named `jsp.exportStems`. 
Move or copy this folder into the appropriate location depending on your operating system.

If you're using macOS: `Macintosh HD/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions`

If you're using Windows: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions`

NOTE: functionality in Windows is not guaranteed.
    
Once you've placed the folder in the appropriate location, launch Adobe Premiere Pro 2023 or later. 
If the application is already running, close and relaunch it.

Run the extension by navigating through the Premiere menu at the top of the screen:
   
    Window -> Extensions -> Export Stems...

NOTE: if there is no active sequence, this extension does nothing.
